# Defi cTH Proposals


### Abstract:
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) popularity is sky rocketing and currently still the #1 use-cases of EVM based blockchains. CheatETH is an EVM based blockchain with real DeFi commuinity since it has shortage of important 3rd party services around DeFi. 
DeFi cTH will provide a roadmap to bring cTH DeFi into a MVP phase!

### Availalbe services:

- https://app.tokendeployer.com/ Support cTH network with 0.01 cTH creation Fee. ! Create CheapSwap router by default !
- https://cheapswap.io/ Support cTH DeFi tokens to provide liquidity. (https://cheapswap.io/#/swap?outputCurrency=YOUR TOKEN ADDRESS)

### Roadmap

#### Phase 1: (The Meme tokens)
- Token creation DAPP, which could be used to deploy safe(audited) ERC-20(21) tokens for wide range of users. Every contract made through the deployer DAPP counted as verified thrustable contract.
- Token listing site, where users can promote/collect available cTH DeFi tokens. 
- Liquidity lock DAPP, liquidity locking is a good way to eliminate rug pull while number of LP providers are low.

#### Phase 2: (Tokenomics)
- Advanced trading tool with time-series price chart, list of holders, list of transaction.
- Contract verification tool, verify contract source codes based on EVM compiler.
- L2 Bridge? :)
